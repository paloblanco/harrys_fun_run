# Harry's Fun Run
## A simple 3D platformer made in LÖVR

This is a test game for the 3D framework LÖVR. It is currently still under development.

## How to run
This is targeted at Windows users.
1. Make sure you have LÖVR on your machine. You can get it from here: https://lovr.org/downloads. There is no windows installer, so I recommend unzipping the archive where you would normally have programs installed (like c:\Programs) and then adding the folder to your path.
2. Once LÖVR is available, you can clone this repo. To run a LÖVR program from source, you just need to call the LÖVR executable and pass the folder containing the repo as an argument. If you added LÖVR to path, you can run something like the below command:
```
C:\src\harrys_fun_run> lovr .
```
